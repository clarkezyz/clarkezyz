My name is Clarke Chaos Zyz.
I developed SHAC (Spherical Harmonic Audio Codec) with the help of Claude Code.
In fact 100% of the code has been written by Claude. I offered guidance and good prompts.

I believe in privacy first, open software that benefits those that use it.
I have always enjoyed computers and I am a student of logic, but I have no formal training in programming or Computer Science.
I hope people see what this code does and understanding that I am just disciplined. With an understanding of how AI works the barries for entry have become legecy.

I am going to be unavailable until 2030. Please fork and build on what I have, or copy it and let it work for you.

Be Impossible.
Maybe in five years I will show you the VisionQuest and NextRound.
