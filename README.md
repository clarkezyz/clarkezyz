My name is Clarke Chaos Zyz. 
I developed SHAC (Spherical Harmonic Audio Codec) with the help of Claude Code. 
In fact, 100% of the code has been written by Claude. I offered vision, guidance, and good prompts. This proves Native AI programming, and it proves anyone can do this. 

I am going to be unavailable until 2030. Please fork and build on what I have or copy it and let it work for you. 

Be Impossible. 
Maybe in five years I will show you the VisionQuest and NextRound.
